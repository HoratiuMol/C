Fundamental Tasks in the cretion of any C program   
    Editing
    Compiling
    Linking
    Executing

These tasks will become second nature since you are doing them so often
Linkin more aware than in other languages

Editing
    Creating the code. Source code inside of a fiel
    choose a name for your base file name
    we will use an IDE(code block) but you can use any program to createh code (notepad, sublime, visual,etc.)
    We wil use CodeBloks(I will use Visual or not, ill try to link it to git)

Compiler
    converts your source code into machine language and detects errors
    input is your file,
    Two stage processing
        preprocessing phase->code may be modified or added to
        compilation-> generates the object code
    Recognizes structural errors(dead code)
    does not fin logic errors
    typical errores reported might be due to an expression that has unbalanced parentheses (syntatic) or due to the use of a variable that is not "defined"(semantic)
    Translate to asembly language  into actual machine instructions
    Output is also known as "object code" and is store in object files (.obj or .o extensino)
    standart comand to compile you C programs will be CC(or the GNU compiler, which is .gcc)
        cc -c myprog.c or gcc -c myprog.C
        if you omit the -c flag your program will automatically be linked as well

Linking
    After compilingand having the object code, it is ready for Linking
    The purpose of this phase is to get the program into a final form for execution on the PC
    linking usually occurs auttomatically when compiling depending on what system you are on, but, sometimes can be a separate comand
    This combines the module generator whit additional libraries needed by the program to creathe the whole executalbe
    also detects and reports erroresif any partt is missing or a nonexisten library coimponent is referenced
    Program libraries support and extends the C language by providing routines t ocarry out operations that are not part of the language.
    input and output libraries, mathematical libraries, string manipulation libraries
    failer-> go back and edit source code
    Succes-> .exe extension 
    If program has significatn size  will consist of several source code files-> each sourrce file need the compiler to generate the .obj output
    Easier to manipualte if broke down into many pieces, more cohesive the dev andd maintainance.

Executing
    open the .exe
    if statement is ran in order
    if dat ais requested->pause unttil you introduce the info or data
    If prodeuces output, you see it on the tterminal or consoel
    Generate errors conditions
        The wwrong output 
        just sitting there and ddo nothing (logic issues)
        crash the PC (sometthing really bad and the program or other programms died)
    Reeditt, reorganize, redesign -> debugging phase

    page where u can download the Linux simulator
        then you must introduce to the System environmetn variables->path->(the rout) C:\cygwin64\bin
