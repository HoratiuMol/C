Computers are dumb machines
    They only do what theyre told told

basic operations of a PC will be kwno as a "Instruction set"

To solve a problem using a pc you provide the solution by sending instructtions to the instructtions

algorithm->how to solve a problem

the test is the one that proves the algorithm

TO write a program u need to implement the algorithm    
    expressend in the statement of a particula computer language, java, c++, objective-c, or c

CPU(Central processing unit)
    does most of ttthe work
    innstruction are exectued here

Ram(Random access memory)
    stores the data of a program while it is running
    memory is much faster than storing it in a hard drive, but it has limitations

Hard drive(permanent storage)
    stores files that containt hte program source code, even if the pC is off

fetch/execute Cycle (life of a CPU)
    fettches an isntruction from memory (using registers) and executttes it(loop)
    A gigahertz CPU can ddo this about a billion times a second


High Level programming languages
        make it easier to understand languages
            opposite of assembly language
            C is a higer level programming langauge thatt describes actions in a more abstractt form
            the instructions(statemns) looks more like solving problems (no need to memorize just understand the language)
            no worry about a particular set of steps a CPU would solve the problem
        
    Compilers
        A program that translaates tthe high-level language source code into the detailed set of machine language instructions the pc requires
        the program does the high-level thinking and the compilere generates the tediious instroncttions to the CPU
        will alos check if the program has a valid syntax for the programming language
            find errors and reports tthem to you and doesn't produce an executable until u fix them
        
    Much easier to learn and program

Writting a program
    1.Define the objectives
        Requirements
        clear idea
            2.Design the program
                meet the requirementts
                interface be like
                program be organized
                    3.Writte the code
                        4.Compile
                            5.Run the program
                                6.Test and debug the program
                                    7.Maintain and modify the program

Most C code is based on C89
C99 is not as much adopted as C89 by Compilers
Current Standart is referre to as c11
