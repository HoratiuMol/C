Computers are dumb machines
    They only do what theyre told told

basic operations of a PC will be kwno as a "Instruction set"

To solve a problem using a pc you provide the solution by sending instructtions to the instructtions

algorithm->how to solve a problem

the test is the one that proves the algorithm

TO write a program u need to implement the algorithm    
    expressend in the statement of a particula computer language, java, c++, objective-c, or c

CPU(Central processing unit)
    does most of ttthe work
    innstruction are exectued here

Ram(Random access memory)
    stores the data of a program while it is running
    memory is much faster than storing it in a hard drive, but it has limitations

Hard drive(permanent storage)
    stores files that containt hte program source code, even if the pC is off

fetch/execute Cycle (life of a CPU)
    fettches an isntruction from memory (using registers) and executttes it(loop)
    A gigahertz CPU can ddo this about a billion times a second


High Level programming languages
        make it easier to understand languages
            opposite of assembly language
            C is a higer level programming langauge thatt describes actions in a more abstractt form
            the instructions(statemns) looks more like solving problems (no need to memorize just understand the language)
            no worry about a particular set of steps a CPU would solve the problem
        
    Compilers
        A program that translaates tthe high-level language source code into the detailed set of machine language instructions the pc requires
        the program does the high-level thinking and the compilere generates the tediious instroncttions to the CPU
        will alos check if the program has a valid syntax for the programming language
            find errors and reports tthem to you and doesn't produce an executable until u fix them
        
    Much easier to learn and program

Writting a program
    1.Define the objectives
        Requirements
        clear idea
            2.Design the program
                meet the requirementts
                interface be like
                program be organized
                    3.Writte the code
                        4.Compile
                            5.Run the program
                                6.Test and debug the program
                                    7.Maintain and modify the program

Most C code is based on C89
C99 is not as much adopted as C89 by Compilers
Current Standart is referre to as c11

Langauge Features
    C produces compact and eficient programs
    C most used programming language
    Main Features   
        Efficietn
        Portable
        Powerful and Flexible
        Programmer Oriented
            Efficiente
                Advantage of the cpabilities of current computer
                c programs are fast and compact(similar to asembly)
                programmers can fine-tune programs for maximun speedd or most efficient use of memory
            Portable
                Wrritten on one system can be run on another system whit little or no moddificatin
                a ladder in protability
                compilers are available for many computers architectures
            Linux/Unix comes witth a C compilere
                Compielrs are avaialble for PC
            Powerful
                Linux/Unix kernes is written in c
                Many compilers for other programs have been written in c
                Solving phisics and engineering problems and even for FX in movies
            Flexibility
                developet to create all u can image
                games and operating systems
                it is basic for more advanced languages such as C++
                Mobile apps in form of Objective c(iOS)
                Easy to learn because of compactness
                knowledge for practical aplication development very quick and very easy
            Program Oriented
                gives u access to hardware
                enables you to manipualte individual bits of memory
                Manage own memory
                Large selection of operators wich allows you to express youserlf succinctly
                C gives u more freedome, but you are the responsible of errors and mistakes
                large library of useful C functions
                deal with common need of most programmers
            Other Features  
                Low lvl features provided by the Lower level languages
                manage memory representation at bit levelwide variety of bit manipulation operators
                Pointers give direct access to memory
                Support efficient use of Pointers

        DDisadvantages
            Flexibvility vs freedmo.
            Pointers may be problematic and abused
            Programming errors that are difficult to trace
            Langauge difficult to read and follow(sometimes)
            chance to write obscure code
